# RealisticNVG-client
My very humble attempt at modding the NVG mask textures without replacing the original bundle.
For now, it's capable of loading a bundle and its assets.
The bundle is realmasks, and it would go in BepInEx\plugins\BorkelRNVG.
The .dll from building the .cs would obviously go in BepInEx\plugins.
The textures I used to build the bundle are in PNGTextures.
